How to express number in computer.

binary digit = Express bit 0,1 in permutation in other words, binary. 4(decimal)=100(binary), 9(decimal)=1001(binary)

In metaphor, 0 and 1 compare on and off about bolb. each number of digit means transistor.

8 bit = 1 byte

How to express character in computer

A=65, B=66, C=67 -> ASCII code : English language in general

Unicode: other languages available

Other solution: Eomji. 4036991106 = face with tears of joy(ios)

How to express color: RGB
Red degree(0~255) + Green(0~255) + Blue(0~255) When mixxing, lots of colors available.

One point(pixel) take color -> lots of colors make image.

Video: Changing pixel as time goes by. Hollywood movie: 24FPS(frame per second)

Music: particular frequency is allocated value.

For solving problem, writing human language instead of algorithm

    verb = function
    condtional = if, else lf
    choice = boolean expressions: yes/no, true/false, 0/1
    go back = loop

input=value -> algorithm=function -> output=side effect

Abstraction: define function. more easy reading, thinking.

Using useful term in value's name

Have to disassemble Massive argorithm into easy tasks
